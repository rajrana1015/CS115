The largest number of bits that the compressor fucntion will be 65 bits as
if  for the input binary string S is that it alternates between '0' and '1'
for all 64 bits, this would result in 64 5-bit binary represtions, but since
we must indeftify that the input string will begin  with a 1 and not a 0
then an additional 5-bit represtion of zero must be place infront of the
output, resulting in a total of 65 bits  """

"""In a comment, argue to NASA that Professor Lai is Lai-ingâ€”such an algorithm cannot
exist! Try to make your reasoning as convincing and water-tight as possible. (In essence, you are
proving that such an algorithm cannot exist.)
Professors Lai's algortitim can not exist as the input and output would both be binary
strings that will result in a different out put when place in  the Laiuncompress function.
For example the image string of a pengunir is "00011000"+"00111100"*3 +"01111110"+"11111111"+"00111100"+"00100100"
or "0001100000111100001111000011110001111110111111110011110000100100" when uncrompressed, when it is compressed it will return 
"00011000100010100100001000010000100001000001100110000010100000010001000010000001000100000100010",
which is a much larger string. Since Lai's compressed will return the shorter of the two strings will return the orignal input
string, however this fail to acknowlegde the laiuncompress function will not be able to uncompress it correctly as it will return
the uncompressed verions or the original string but it will not be able to tell its already uncompssed thus reuturning an incorrect string.
For exmaple in our exmaple it would reutrn
"0000000000000000000000000000000001110000000000000000000000001111111111111110001111111111111111111111111111110000000000000000000000000000000

instead of "0001100000111100001111000011110001111110111111110011110000100100"
